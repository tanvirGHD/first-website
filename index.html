                <h2>TANVIR AHAMMAD</h2>
                <p> I am a student in Dhaka international University Department of Computer science an Engineering.Computer Science is like a magical world where we give computers instructions to do things for us. You can think of it as teaching your computer to solve puzzles. It’s the study of how computers work, and how we can make them work better for us. We use a special language to talk to computers, which is called coding or programming. When you play games or use apps on your smartphone, the computer science experts, also known as programmers or coders, have written lots of instructions, or codes, for them to work. They can make fun games, cool apps, and even robots! Using computer science, we can solve tricky math problems, create beautiful art, and even help doctors treat people who are sick. It’s like a giant toolbox that lets you build anything you can dream of! By learning computer science, you can become a creator in this digital world, not just a user. It’s a bit like learning how to read and write, but instead of words and sentences, we use codes. So, computer science is very important and fun to learn.</p>
